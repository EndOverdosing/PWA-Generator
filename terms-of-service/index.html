                <p>By accessing or using PWA Maker ("the Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If
                    you disagree

                <h3>Use of the Service</h3>
                <p>PWA Maker provides a tool for generating a Progressive Web App (PWA) package that wraps a third-party
                    website.
                    You are granted a license to use the generated output for personal or internal business use. You
                    agree not to
                    use the Service for any unlawful purpose. You are solely responsible for ensuring you have the right
                    to access
                    and wrap the content of any URL you provide.</p>

                <h3>Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p>The Service is provided "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE". We make no warranties regarding the functionality
                    or
                    reliability of the generated PWA package. Many websites employ security measures (such as
                    `X-Frame-Options` or
                    Content-Security-Policy headers) that actively prevent them from being embedded in other sites,
                    which will cause
                    the generated PWA to fail. We do not guarantee that any given website will function correctly when
                    wrapped.</p>
                <p>In no event shall we be liable for any damages arising from your use of the Service. We are not
                    affiliated with,
                    nor do we endorse, any website you choose to wrap. We are not responsible for the content,
                    functionality, or
                    terms of any third-party website.</p>

                    Service
                    after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
