                <h3>Our Core Principle: Client-Side Processing</h3>
                <p>PWA Maker is designed to be a privacy-first, client-side tool. This means all the
                    processing—generating files,
                    handling your app icons, and creating the PWA package—happens directly in your web browser on your
                    own device.
                    We believe this is the most private and secure approach.</p>

                <h3>Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
                <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit any of the information you enter into the generator. This
                    includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The website URLs you wish to wrap.</li>
                    <li>Your App Name, Short Name, or Description.</li>
                    <li>Your color selections or other configuration choices.</li>
                    <li>The app icons you upload. Your icon is processed in your browser and is never sent to our
                        servers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All generated files are created on-the-fly in your browser and are made available for you to download
                    directly in
                    a single package.</p>

                <h3>Important Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>While PWA Maker does not collect your data, the PWA you create will load a third-party website. Your
                    interaction
                    with the content inside the generated PWA is governed by the privacy policy and data collection
                    practices of
                    that specific website. PWA Maker has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content
                    or privacy
                    practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>
