# PWA Forge: Website to PWA Generator

## Instantly turn any website into a fully customizable and installable Progressive Web App (PWA) with a shareable link.

PWA Forge allows users to transform any website URL into a personalized Progressive Web App without writing a single line of code. Configure app name, colors, display mode, and upload a custom icon. The generated PWA becomes live on a unique path of *your* site, ready to be installed directly from the browser, and can be shared via a persistent URL.

This project is designed to be self-contained, handling icon uploads via a Vercel Serverless Function, ensuring no external third-party APIs are required for its core functionality.

## ✨ Features

*   **Website to PWA Conversion:** Wrap any website URL into an installable PWA.
*   **Customizable Metadata:** Define your PWA's name, short name, and description.
*   **Dynamic Theming:** Select custom theme and background colors using an integrated advanced color picker.
*   **Display Mode Options:** Choose between `standalone`, `fullscreen`, or `minimal-ui` for the PWA experience.
*   **Custom App Icon:** Upload your own image file (recommended 512x512) for the PWA icon.
*   **Shareable PWA Links:** Generate a unique URL for your custom-configured PWA. Anyone visiting this URL will get your personalized PWA experience instantly.
*   **Live PWA Wrapper:** Experience the PWA directly within the browser context after generation, making it immediately installable.
*   **Draggable Exit Button:** A convenient, draggable "X" button is provided within the PWA wrapper to easily return to the generator.
*   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, including light/dark theme toggling.
*   **No External APIs (Self-contained):** Icon uploads are processed by a Vercel Serverless Function that converts images to Base64 data URIs, removing dependency on external image hosting services.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get this project up and running locally or deploy it:

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
*   [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/docs/cli) installed globally (`npm install -g vercel`).

### Local Development

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/endoverdosing/pwa-forge.git
    cd pwa-forge
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The `formidable` library is used by the serverless function.
    ```bash
    npm install formidable
    ```

3.  **Run the development server:**
    This command will start the Vercel development server, which automatically handles your frontend and the serverless function in `api/upload.js`.
    ```bash
    vercel dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
