                <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                <p>PWA Maker was created to bridge the gap between the web and native apps. Our mission is to provide an
                    intuitive,
                    powerful tool that lets you take any website and wrap it into an installable Progressive Web App.
                    This allows
                    for a focused, full-screen experience without browser tabs and address bars, making your favorite
                    websites feel
                    like native applications on your desktop or mobile device.</p>

                <h3>Why PWA Maker?</h3>
                <p>We handle all the technical details—generating the manifest, creating a service worker for basic
                    offline
                    capabilities, and resizing icons—so you don't have to. Simply provide a URL, customize the app's
                    appearance, and
                    download a complete PWA package ready for deployment. It's the fastest way to create a dedicated,
                    installable
                    app for a news site, social media platform, internal company tool, or any other website you use
                    frequently.</p>

                <h3>Privacy First and Free Forever</h3>
                <p>This tool is completely free to use and respects your privacy. All processing happens directly in
                    your browser.
                    The URLs you enter and the icons you upload are never sent to our servers. We believe in the power
                    of an open
                    and accessible web, and PWA Maker is our contribution to making it even more versatile.</p>
